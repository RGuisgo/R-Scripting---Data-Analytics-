Impacts of Macroeconomic Variables on Foreign Direct Investment in
Ghana: An Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bounds Test
Approach in R

Foreign Direct Investment is a critical component of global economic integration and plays a significant
role in driving economic growth and development, and therefore macroeconomic factors play a crucial
role in shaping the attractiveness of a country as a destination for foreign direct investment, influencing
investment decisions and capital flows. Macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product growth
rate, inflation, exchange rates, external debt, and trade openness can significantly impact foreign direct
investment flows. A favourable macroeconomic environment is generally associated with increased
foreign direct investment inflows, while unfavourable conditions can deter foreign investors. The research
employed yearly time series data spanning from 1990 to 2020, and utilized the autoregressive distributed
lag model to investigate the relationship between macroeconomic variables and foreign direct investment.
The findings of the study indicated co-integration among these macroeconomic variables, suggesting
a long-term relationship between them and foreign direct investment. Specifically, both the shortrun
and long-run analyses revealed that External Debt had a statistically significant negative impact on
foreign direct investment, while Trade Openness and Exchange Rate had positive effects on foreign direct
investment in the long run in Ghana. The absolute value of the Error Correction Model was considerably
large and statistically significant, confirming the long-term association between the variables.
